# Healthcare Provider Exclusion Risk

This is a portfolio project I built to predict which healthcare providers are at risk of being excluded (terminated) by the US OIG, and to let someone ask questions about the exclusion data in plain English.

The problem it's aimed at: a health plan that pays a claim to a provider who has been excluded by the OIG can end up on the hook for that money. Today a lot of that checking is reactive. The idea here is to score providers up front so the risky ones get looked at first, instead of everyone getting reviewed in the order they happen to come in.

## Data

Two public US government datasets, both free to download:

- **NPPES** – the national registry of every provider and their NPI number.
- **OIG LEIE** – the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities, i.e. providers the OIG has already excluded.

I worked with a ~500K sample of NPPES and cross-referenced it against the full LEIE to build a labelled dataset (excluded vs not). Everything shown in the notebook outputs comes from these public files, there's no private or client data anywhere in here.

The raw and processed data files are not committed to the repo (they're large and you can pull them from the source), so `data/` is gitignored.

## What's in here

The work is split across six notebooks that run in order:

1. `01_data_ingestion` – load NPPES + LEIE, join them, build the labelled dataset.
2. `02_eda` – exploring the data and where the exclusion signal actually is.
3. `03_modelling` – training the risk model.
4. `04_rag_pipeline` – embedding the LEIE records and setting up retrieval so you can ask questions over them.
5. `05_langgraph` – a small agent that decides whether a question needs a lookup over the exclusion data or a risk score for a specific provider.
6. `06_serving` – wrapping the model as an API.

`serving/` holds the deployable version of the scorer (the model file, a FastAPI app, and a Dockerfile).

## The model

I went with XGBoost. The dataset is very imbalanced (excluded providers are rare), so accuracy on its own is misleading, catching the rare positive cases (recall) matters more, and XGBoost handled that well with class weighting.

A few things that came out of the EDA and stuck around as real signal:

- Providers in **Pain Management and Addiction Medicine** get excluded at roughly 10x the baseline rate.
- **Individual providers** (NPPES Entity Type 1) are excluded about 5x more often than organisations (Type 2).
- Exclusion rates vary a lot by state (Kentucky came out around 2x the national average in the sample).

The model outputs a risk score between 0 and 1 that you'd use to sort a review queue.

## The RAG + agent part

On top of the scoring model I added a retrieval layer over the LEIE records. The exclusion records get embedded with a sentence-transformers model and stored in Qdrant, and a question gets answered from the retrieved records using Gemini, grounded only in what was retrieved rather than the model's own memory.

The agent (built with LangGraph) sits in front of that. It reads the question and routes it: if you're asking for a provider's risk score it pulls the NPI and runs the model, if you're asking about the exclusion data generally it goes to retrieval. The Qdrant store is rebuilt from the data by notebook 04, so it isn't committed either.

## What's actually deployed vs a prototype

I want to be straight about this because it matters:

- The **XGBoost scoring service is deployed** to Google Cloud Run (FastAPI + Docker).
- The **RAG pipeline and the LangGraph agent run in the notebooks** as a working prototype. They aren't deployed as a service.

## Still in progress

- A RAGAS evaluation harness with a golden question set, to actually measure the RAG answers instead of eyeballing them.
- Role-based access on retrieval (RBAC), so different users only see what they're allowed to.

## A note / disclaimer

This is a portfolio and learning project. It's built on public data and it's meant to *prioritise* human review, not to make a final decision about any provider. Any real use would need proper validation and a human in the loop.
